This app uses Javascript as well as node to act as a purchasing invoice, and web site to purchase from. This app uses mysql to hold the inventory, and all the info a customer needs to use to purchase a product, as well as how many units of the product they wish to purchase. The customer will see a table of what is offered and how many of each they can purchase.  

With a couple questions to the customer we get what they would like to purchase and how many units of that product they would like to purchase. If the customer inputs as realistic quantity they will be thanked, bringing an end to the transaction. If they require more units than we have in stock, they will then be asked if they would like to purchase again with a number that is well within the stock quantity we have available for purchase.
